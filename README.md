Project Title : Learning Tracker App

Purpose: The goal of this application is to help users achieve their learning objectives by organizing and tracking daily progress. The app provides a system for setting learning goals and a time duration, enabling users to maintain a learning streak or freeze a day when needed, encouraging discipline in reaching their goals.

Functionality:

Onboarding: Users start by entering their learning goal and selecting a time duration to achieve it (week, month, or year). This initial setup tailors the app experience based on the chosen goal and duration.

Logging Daily Progress:

Users can log a day as “Learned” or freeze it.
Learned Today: When a day is logged as "Learned," the streak count increases by +1, and the current day in the calendar is marked with an orange circle.
Freeze Day: Freezing a day increases the frozen day count by +1, and the day is marked with a blue circle in the calendar. Depending on the chosen duration, users have a limited number of freezes (2 per week, 6 per month, 60 per year).
Updating Goal or Duration:

Users can update the learning goal or adjust the time duration. When either of these is updated, the streak and frozen day counts are reset.
Update Learning Goal: The new goal is reflected as a title at the top of the main screen.
Update Duration: Adjusts the available freeze days according to the newly chosen option.
Streak Management:

The learning streak resets under certain conditions:
After spending more than 32 hours without logging a day as "Learned."
After updating both the learning goal and duration together.
Upon finishing the specified duration
